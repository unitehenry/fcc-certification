# Free Code Camp Full-Stack Certification

This is a repository with some of the code I used to complete my Free Code Camp Full-Stack Certification. Check out all my Free Code Cap progress [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fccc1c4406e-646e-478d-a7b6-771d8c2139ba).

## Front End 

The ```front-end``` directory is a simple expressjs and webpack configuration that I used to work on the following certifications:

1. [Front End Libraries](https://codepen.io/collection/AyPmdy)
2. [Data Visualization Projects](https://codepen.io/collection/AzPqap)
3. [Responsive Web Design](https://codepen.io/collection/AvWOaj)

After developing these projects locally, I just moved the code into my [codepen.io](https://codepen.io).

## APIs and Microservices

The ```api``` directory is where I keep the code for my *APIs and Microservices* certification. I used a heroku dyno to host my services.
