# Front-End Development Environment

You can use this location to work on any front end Free Code Camp projects.

## Getting Started

Begin by installing dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

I recommend using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to locally serve your project for development.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```

After nodemon is running, run webpack in watch mode.

```sh
npx webpack -w
```

You can begin working on your application that's hosted at ```http://localhost:3000```.

## Working on Projects

In the ```src``` directory, you can begin working on projects in these files:

1. ```index.html```
2. ```index.css```
3. ```app.js```
